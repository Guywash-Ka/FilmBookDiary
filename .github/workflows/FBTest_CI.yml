# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the develop branch 
on: 
  push: 
    branches: [ master ] 
  pull_request: 
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel 
jobs: 
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
